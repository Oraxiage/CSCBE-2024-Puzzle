# Puzzle
My niece asked me some help with her puzzle, but I am not sure how to solve it.
I spent a lot of time on it, but I don't think I will be able to help my niece.
I left you with the instructions and the puzzle, please help her.

## How to play:
1. The cursor starts at the top-left corner
2. Use l, r, u, d to move the cursor left, right, up, or down
3. Use b to place the number at the cursor's position into the buffer, this will also place the number currently in the buffer at the cursor's position
4. You have 10 seconds to send back your solution. Example: 'llduburbdlb'
5. The buffer starts with 0, and must end with 0

Here's an example:
